Time Calculator

This Python project implements a time calculator that adds a duration to a given start time in 12-hour AM/PM format. It supports optional input for the starting day of the week and accounts for multiple days passing. The function returns the updated time, the day of the week (if provided), and information on whether the result is on the next day or several days later. The project avoids importing any external libraries and focuses on basic string manipulation and arithmetic operations.
